    <!-- A ternary operator can be used to replace an if..else statement in certain situations. -->
    <!-- What is a Ternary operator?
A ternary operator evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition.

Its syntax is:

condition ? expression1 : expression2
The ternary operator evaluates the test condition.

If the condition is true, expression1 is executed.
If the condition is false, expression2 is executed.
The ternary operator takes three operands, hence, the name ternary operator. 
It is also known as a conditional operator. -->

    <script>
      // program to check pass or fail

      let marks = prompt("Enter your marks :");

      // check the condition
      let result = marks >= 40 ? "pass" : "fail";

      console.log(`You ${result} the exam.`);

      console.log("***********");
      // check the age to determine the eligibility to vote
      let age = 15;
      let res;

      if (age >= 18) {
        res = "You are eligible to vote.";
      } else {
        res = "You are not eligible to vote yet.";
      }

      console.log(res);

      console.log("***********");

      // ternary operator to check the eligibility to vote
      let _age = 28;
      let _result =
        _age >= 18
          ? "You are eligible to vote."
          : "You are not eligible to vote yet";
      console.log(_result);

      console.log("Nested ternary operators");
