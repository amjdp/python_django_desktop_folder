      <h1>CSS Comments</h1>
      <p>
        The comments are used to add a description for the code to make it more
        understandable. The comment text is ignored by the browser and are not
        interpreted by the interpreter.
      </p>
      <p>
        In CSS, the comments are represented by the /* and */ sign and these are
        used within the &nbsp; &lt;style&gt; &nbsp; tag or in the external CSS.
