    <h1>CSS Selectors - Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      When we have to apply some style rules to any HTML tag, we use CSS by
      selecting any HTML tag using the tag name. But is that the only way to
      style an HTML tag? Do we always have to use tag name selector to add CSS
      styling rule?
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, in this lesson, we will cover a few more
        ways to select HTML tags and add style to them.

    <p>
        CSS selectors are used to
        pointing out the HTML element for which the CSS properties are specified.
        You can use any element name, class, and id attribute to specify the CSS
        property.

        You will learn more about it in our CSS Selector module. For this
        lesson, let's focus on the tagname or element selector and get used to
        writing CSS code.

    <h3>Basic Syntax:</h3>
    <p>
        In the previous lessons, we have used
        tagname/element selector to add style rules.

        div{ color: red; } 
    </p>
