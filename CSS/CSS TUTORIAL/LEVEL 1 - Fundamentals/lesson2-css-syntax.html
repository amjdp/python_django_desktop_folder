    <h1> CSS Syntax </h1>
    <p>
     The syntax is a set of rules that defines the structure of any
      language, or the way in which we write code in any programming language.
      The basic CSS syntax consists of a selector and a declaration block.
      </p>
      <p>
      Where, the selector points out the HTML element/tag for which you want to
      set the styling properties. 
      </p>
      <p>And, the declaration block, which starts and
      ends with opening and closing curly braces ({}). The declaration block
      contains CSS property and value in the form of property: value pair. You
      can also specify multiple CSS properties within the declaration block and
      each property is separated from the other using a semicolon (;). 
     </p>

     <p>
      The selector is used to select or pick a particular HTML tag from a
      webpage(which is made of many HTML tags) on which any style has to be
      applied. And it can be done in other ways too, like naming a tag using
      class or id attribute, which we will learn in detail in later lesson.
    </p>

        Here is the basic syntax:
        p { color: red;}
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
