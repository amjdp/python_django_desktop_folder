        What is Box Model?
In this level, we will learn about the box model.

Every element that is created using HTML tags is considered a box. The CSS box model is used to describe the structure of any HTML element on a webpage and how they are rendered on the webpage. It represents the various sections of an HTML element, these sections are:

Content box: This is the area where the content of the element is displayed which can be an image or text, etc.
Padding: It specifies the space between the border(boundary of the element) and the content of the box. This is the empty space around the content inside the element.
Border: This is the area present around the content box(the boundary).
Margin: It specifies the space outside the border of the element, between the current element and other adjacent HTML element.
The following image demonstrates the pictorial representation of the elements of the box model.
