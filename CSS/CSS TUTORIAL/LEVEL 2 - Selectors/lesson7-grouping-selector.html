    <p>
      The CSS allows us to group the CSS selectors too. The grouping of CSS
      selectors is useful when we want to specify the same styling properties on
      multiple elements. So, instead of specifying the same properties again and
      again, we can group them together which also helps in minimizing the CSS
      code also.
    </p>
    <div class="para">
      We can group selectors of the same type, such as HTML tag with other HTML
      tags, a class selector with other class selectors, etc. or even different
      types such as element selector with class selector, an element selector
      with id selector, a class selector with the element selector, etc., and
      these selectors are separated using a comma.
