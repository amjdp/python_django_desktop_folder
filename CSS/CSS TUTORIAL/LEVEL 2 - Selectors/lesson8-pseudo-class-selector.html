    <h1>CSS pseudo-class Selector</h1>
    <p>
      The CSS pseudo-class selectors are the CSS selectors with a colon
      preceding them. These pseudo-classes are used to add a special effect to
      the HTML element.
    </p>
    <p>
      While using any website, one very common effect that you must have seen
      is, when you take your mouse cursor over any link or button, the styling
      changes for it, it can be change of color, or underlining the text, etc.,
      that is because of the pseudo-class :hover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, we have many other pseudo-class selectors in CSS, which we can
      use to add some style rules to our HTML element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another example of pseudo-class is that when we click on any link then by
      default in HTML, color of the link text turns from blue to purple. The
      blue color represents an unvisited link and the purple color represents
      that we have already visited that link.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hence, using the pseudo-class selector, we can easily make our webpage
      more responsive to user actions like mouse hover, click on some HTML
      element, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>Syntax for pseudo-class Selector:</h3>

    &lt;selector&gt;:&lt;pseudo-class&gt; { /* CSS property*/ }

    <p>
      n the syntax above, &lt;selector&gt; can be an element/tagname selector,
      class selector, id selector, etc. while &lt;pseudo-class&gt; represents
      the pseudo-class selector listed below.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        :hover - The :hover selector is used to styling elements when we move
        the cursor over the element. This selector is mostly used with the links
        or the buttons but we can also use it with any HTML element.
      </li>
      <li>
        :visited - The :visited selector selects all the visited links. This
        selector changes the styling of all the visited links in the browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        :checked - This selector selects all the checked elements such as
        checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdowns. To apply CSS properties or any
        special effect using the :checked selector, we need to first mark it
        checked. It does not apply the CSS properties until the element is
        checked.
      </li>
      <li>
        :disabled - This selector selects the input field which consists of the
        disabled attribute.
      </li>
      <li>
        :required - This selector selects the input field that has the required
        attribute and then applies all the specified CSS properties to them
      </li>
    </ul>
  </body>
