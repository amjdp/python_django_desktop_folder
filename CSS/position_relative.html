        Static(default)
        Relative
        Absolute
        Fixed
        Sticky

        positioning keywords - offset
        top, bottom, left, right
        + offset inwards
        - offset outwards

        relative - positioned according to itself - its original position - 
        moves from its original position
        you can use two keywords - top,right - top,left - bottom,right - bottom,left
        don't use opposing sides as keywords - i.e. top,bottom - right,left

        document flow - inline(image,links,inputs), block(div,paragraph,lists)
        default behaviour of tags - to change display : block | inline;

        relative - elements are not removed from the document flow - 
                - do not modify the document flow visually they just move visually and 
                the other elements appear where they normally would
        
        absolute - positioned according to the nearest containing element 
                 - positioned based on another element or the nearest parent element
                 - elements are removed from document flow

        fixed - according to viewport (browser window)
              - works basically the exact same way as the absolute positioning works
              - except the parent element is always the viewport
              - elements are removed from the document flow

        sticky - containing element(with conditions)
               - its treated as relatively positioned until its containing block crosses a specified
               - threshold(such as setting top to value other than auto) within its flow root(or the container
               - it scrolls within), at which point it is treated as "stuck" 
               - until meeting edge of its containing block
               - behaves like relative until its stuck & then it behaves like fixed

        z-index : higher z-index are on top of lowr z-indexes
