-- A view and a SELECT statement are related concepts, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

-- SELECT Statement:
-- A SELECT statement is a fundamental SQL command used to retrieve data from one or more tables. 
-- It allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve, the table(s) you want to retrieve data from, 
-- and conditions for filtering the data.

-- For example:

-- SELECT column1, column2
-- FROM table_name
-- WHERE condition;

-- A SELECT statement is executed at the time it is run. It fetches the data from the specified table(s) and 
-- returns the result set to the client. It doesn't store the result set anywhere permanently.

-- View:
-- A view is a virtual table that is defined by a SELECT statement. It's a saved query that can be used to 
-- simplify complex queries, present data in a specific format, or restrict access to certain columns of a table. 
-- A view does not store the actual data; it stores the definition of the query that generates the data when the view is queried.

-- When you create a view, you define the SELECT statement that defines the data to be displayed by the view. Later, 
-- when you query the view, the underlying SELECT statement is executed to produce the result set.

-- For example, you can create a view like this:

-- CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
-- SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
-- FROM employees
-- WHERE department = 'Sales';

-- And then query the view:

-- SELECT * FROM employee_view;


-- The main differences between a view and a SELECT statement are:

-- Persistence: A view is a persistent object stored in the database schema, whereas a SELECT statement is a transient operation 
-- that fetches data at the moment of execution.

-- Reusability: A view can be reused in multiple queries, making it useful for encapsulating logic and reducing query complexity. 
-- A SELECT statement is standalone and not reusable by other queries.

-- Abstraction: A view abstracts the underlying tables and allows you to present data in a more user-friendly manner. 
-- A SELECT statement directly fetches data from tables without any abstraction.

-- In summary, a SELECT statement is used to fetch data from tables in real-time, 
-- whereas a view is a saved query that creates a virtual table in the database, offering abstraction and 
-- reusability for complex queries and data presentation.

-- In the context of database management systems and database design, 
-- there are three important types of schemas: 
-- external schema, conceptual schema, and physical schema. 
-- Each schema serves a distinct purpose in the organization and management of data 
-- within a database system.

-- External Schema:

-- Purpose: An external schema, also known as a user schema or user view, 
-- defines how data is presented to end-users or applications. 
-- It represents the logical view of the data as seen by specific user groups or applications.

-- Characteristics:
-- External schemas are designed to provide a simplified and tailored view of the database to 
-- meet the specific needs of different user groups or applications.
-- They define which tables, columns, and relationships are visible to each user or application.
-- External schemas abstract away the complexity of the underlying database structure and allow users 
-- to interact with the data in a way that makes sense for their tasks.

-- Example: In a university database, there might be external schemas for students, professors, 
-- and administrators, each showing relevant data and hiding unnecessary details.

-- Conceptual Schema:

-- Purpose: A conceptual schema, also known as a logical schema, represents the overall structure 
-- of the entire database system independently of any specific application or user view. 
-- It serves as an abstract, high-level description of the data model.

-- Characteristics:
-- The conceptual schema defines entities, their attributes, relationships, and constraints across 
-- the entire database system.
-- It provides a unified and comprehensive representation of the data, allowing for data integrity 
-- and consistency.
-- Changes to the conceptual schema typically require careful consideration and should not impact 
-- the external schemas or physical implementation.

-- Example: In an e-commerce database, the conceptual schema would define entities 
-- like "products," "customers," and "orders" and the relationships between them.

-- Physical Schema:

-- Purpose: A physical schema, also known as a storage schema, describes how data is physically stored,
-- indexed, and organized within the underlying storage system (e.g., file system, disks, memory).

-- Characteristics:
-- It specifies the storage structures, file organizations, and access paths used to optimize data 
-- retrieval and storage efficiency.
-- Physical schemas are concerned with aspects such as data storage formats, indexing methods, 
-- and data partitioning.
-- Changes to the physical schema should not affect the external or conceptual schemas, preserving 
-- data independence.

-- Example: In a relational database, the physical schema might specify the use of B-tree indexes, 
-- data file placement on specific storage devices, and caching mechanisms.
-- These three types of schemas are part of the three-schema architecture, which separates the 
-- user/application view (external schema), the logical data model (conceptual schema), and 
-- the physical data storage (physical schema). This separation promotes data independence, 
-- allowing changes to one schema without affecting the others, and facilitates better management 
-- and maintenance of database systems, especially in complex environments with multiple users and 
-- applications.

-- In a relational database management system (RDBMS), database objects are the fundamental building blocks that enable you to store, 
-- manipulate, and manage data. These objects represent different aspects of the database structure and functionality. 

-- Common database objects include:

-- Tables: Tables are the most fundamental database objects. 
-- They store data in rows and columns, following a defined schema. 
-- Each table represents a specific entity or concept in your application. 
-- For example, you might have a "users" table to store user information or a "products" table to store product details.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Views: Views are virtual tables that are generated by queries. 
-- They allow you to encapsulate complex queries into a named object. 
-- Views can be used for data abstraction, security, and simplifying complex queries. 
-- Users can query views just like tables.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Indexes: Indexes are data structures used to improve the retrieval performance of rows in a table. 
-- They provide quick access to data based on the values in one or more columns. 
-- Indexes can significantly speed up search and retrieval operations, but they consume disk space and impact write performance.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Sequences: Sequences are used to generate unique numeric values, typically for use in primary keys. 
-- They are often used for generating auto-incrementing or unique identifier values.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Constraints: Constraints are rules that enforce data integrity and maintain consistency in the database. 
-- Common types of constraints include primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, unique constraints, and check constraints.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Triggers: Triggers are special stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to specific database events, 
-- such as data modifications (insert, update, delete). Triggers are used to enforce business rules or perform additional actions 
-- when certain events occur.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code that accept parameters and return a value or perform an action. 
-- In databases, functions can be categorized as scalar functions (returning a single value) or table-valued functions 
-- (returning a result set).

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Stored Procedures: Stored procedures are precompiled and stored in the database. 
-- They contain a set of SQL statements and can accept parameters. 
-- Stored procedures are often used for encapsulating business logic and can be called from applications.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- User-Defined Types: User-defined types allow you to create custom data types tailored to your application's needs. 
-- These types can be used as columns in tables or as parameter and return types for functions and procedures.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Roles and Users: Roles and users are security-related database objects. 
-- Roles are used to group users and assign permissions, while users are individual entities that connect to the database. 
-- Roles and users are crucial for managing access control.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Schema: A schema is a logical container that groups related database objects together. 
-- It helps organize and manage objects and can be useful for access control, object naming, and data organization.

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- These are some of the essential database objects you'll encounter in an RDBMS like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server. 
-- Understanding how to create, use, and manage these objects is fundamental to working with relational databases effectively. 
-- The specific database system you are using may have additional or slightly different objects and features, 
-- but these are common across many relational databases.
