# tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable
# tuples are immutable - you can't change any value in a tuple


# three_numbers = (1, 2, 3)
# print(three_numbers)
# print(type(three_numbers))
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# three_numbers[1] = 5

# tuples allow repetition of numbers or repetition of values
# three_numbers = (1, 2, 3, 1, 2)
# print(three_numbers)
# print(len(three_numbers))

# it allows various data types

# strings = ('home', 'land', 'earth')
# print(strings)

# boo = (True, False)
# print(boo)

# a = (1, 2, 'three', False, 2, True, 'six')
# print(a)

# print(type(a))

# print(type(a[2]))
# print(type(a[3]))
